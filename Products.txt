
Products.java

The role of this class in your shopping cart application is just to provide you with the store products. 
In other words, this class is used to initialize your store as soon as the application is started. 
As you can see, the initStoreItems() methods is used to add the products into a new ArrayList which is the type Product.
As we have provided the Product class inside the <> braces as new ArrayList(),
 this will tell the compiler that the list is of type Product and it can only contain an item which belongs to type Product.
